[Natasha Kravchuk](https://natashaskitchen.com/about/) from
[Natasha's Kitchen](https://natashaskitchen.com/) calls these "company potatoes"
because they are a dish you make when you want to impress guests. Well, my only
guest was my wife, and she was plenty impressed.

Note, I sized this down for serving 2 (with leftovers), see below.

## Ingredients (10 servings)

- 5 lbs yukon gold potatoes
- 2 tsp sea salt, for boiling potatoes + more or to taste for seasoning the
  potatoes
- 1 bay leaf, optional
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter, or 12 Tbsp, melted
- 1 bunch parsley, finely chopped (1 cup)

## Ingredients (3 servings)

- 3 yukon gold potatoes
- 1/4 tsp sea salt, for boiling potatoes + more to taste for seasoning
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 Tbsp melted butter
- 1 small handful parsley, finely chopped

## Instructions

- Scrub potatoes with a clean scouring pad or the rough back of a sponge (no
  need to peel them). Slice potatoes into 1 – 1 1/2″ thick pieces, transfer to a
  pot and add enough warm water to barely cover potatoes. Sprinkle with 2 tsp
  salt add bay leaf.

- Bring to a boil then boil partially covered for about 15 minutes or until
  easily pierced with a fork. Drain potatoes. Drizzle with melted butter and
  toss to coat (note: it’s easier to toss in a large mixing bowl).

- Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt or to taste. Add 1 cup chopped parsley and toss to
  combine. Toss again just before serving to re-coat with any butter that has
  collected at the bottom.
