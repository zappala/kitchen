This recipe from [Karli](https://cookingwithkarli.com/about-me/) uses a whole
tablespoon of vanilla extract and makes a great cookie. The original recipe is
at her
[Cookies for Days](https://cookiesfordays.com/chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe/)
website.

The recipe officially makes 30 cookies but I always come up short. For me, this
makes about 2 dozen cookies.

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup salted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup favorite chocolate chips

## Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 350° F.

- In the bowl of a stand mixer or with an electric hand mixer, cream together
  the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar until light in color and fluffy
  in texture.

- Scrape the sides of the bowl and add in the egg and vanilla extract. Mix until
  well combined.

- Add in the flour, soda and salt. Mix until a soft but not sticky dough forms.

- Fold in your favorite chocolate chips.

- Scoop the dough out into 1 1/2 tbsp portions (a #40 cookie scoop works great
  here) and arrange on your cookie sheet. Can use parchment paper, a silicone
  mat or an uncreased cookie sheet.

- Bake at 350° F for 8-10 minutes or until the cookies have spread and are just
  beginning to turn golden brown on the edges.

- Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a
  wire cooling rack.
