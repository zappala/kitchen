This is a family favorite recipe. I first made a quiche when we were visiting my
wife's aunt, Sage, and found a Julia Child cookbook in her kitchen. I made Julia
Child's recipe then, and for many years, before pivoting to this one by
[Elise Bauer](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/elise-bauer-5091824), the founder of
[Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/), one of my favorite sites.

Elise's recipe is actually three separate recipes, one for
[Pâte Brisée](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/all_butter_crust_for_sweet_and_savory_pies_pate_brisee/),
one for
[blind baking a pie crust](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_blind_bake_a_pie_crust/),
and finally the recipe for
[quiche Lorraine](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/quiche_lorraine/). I've
combined them all here, for easy reference, plus added a few of my own small
twists. One of my additions is some broccoli, a personal preference. You can
skip this and add chives or green onions instead. Or try caramelized onions!

## Crust Ingredients

- 1 1/4 cups (160g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick, 112g) chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes (I
  cut the stick lengthwise twice, then into cubes)
- 4 tablespoons ice water, very cold

## Crust Instructions

- Place the flour, salt, and sugar into a food processor and pulse until well
  combined.

- Add half of the butter cubes and pulse until pebbly. Then add the other half
  of the butter cubes and pulse. You should have a mixture that resembles a
  coarse meal, with many butter pieces the size of peas.

- Add one tablespoons of ice cold water to the food processor bowl at a time,
  and pulse several times after each tablespoon. Add all four tablespoons.

- Remove the crumbly mixture from the food processor and place on a very clean,
  smooth surface. Then, use your hands to press the crumbly dough together and
  shape into a disk. Work the dough only enough to just bring the dough
  together.

- Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.

- Remove dough from refrigerator, and let sit for 15 minutes.

- Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F degrees.

- Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough, then roll it out until it is big
  enough to fill the pie plate. Sprinkle a little flour occasionally to keep
  from sticking.

- Transfer the dough to a pie plate and press into the dish. Trim any excess
  with scissors and shape as desired.

- Line the foil and fill with pie weights. Cook for 20-30 minutes until the
  crust begins to brown.

## Quiche Ingredients

- 1/2 pound (225g) bacon (about 6 slices)
- 1 small crown of broccoli, cut into small florets
- 1 cup (235 ml) milk
- 1/2 cup (118 ml) heavy cream
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or less to taste
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup (113 g) grated gruyere or swiss cheese

## Quiche Instructions

- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the bacon on top, put this
  into the oven, and _then_ turn the oven on to 400°F. This will help the bacon
  to render as the oven heats.

- Line another baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut broccoli and place it on
  the sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, toss, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  Place the broccoli in the oven, on the shelf beneath the bacon.

- Cook broccoli and bacon about 10 to 12 minutes more. They should both be ready
  about the same time, but if not you can always take one of them out and leave
  the other in for a few more minutes.

- Drain the bacon on paper towels, then chop roughly.

- Preheat the oven to 350°F.

- Whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Add the nutmeg, salt, black pepper and chives
  and whisk a little more. Add the milk and cream and whisk vigorously to
  incorporate and introduce a little air into the mix – this keeps the texture
  of the quiche light and fluffy.

- Put the broccoli in the pie. Add the egg mixture all around it. Sprinkle the
  cheese on top, then mix it a little with a fork to get it to float in the
  middle. Sprinkle the bacon on top, but push it down a little so it is in the
  egg.

- Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until nicely browned and puffed up. When you jiggle
  the quiche, it should wiggle a slight amount but should be mostly solid. I
  usually bake on the convection setting and it takes about 30 to 35 minutes.

- We always eat this while it is still warm. You can eat cold or reheat in a
  200°F oven. If you insist you can reheat in the microwave, but I will think
  less of you. ☺️ It is a lot better reheated in the oven.
