I'm a huge fan of [Nagi](https://www.recipetineats.com/nagi-recipetin-eats/) and
her [RecipeTin Eats](https://www.recipetineats.com/) blog. She has a wonderful
chicken piccata recipe.

Makes 3 or 4 servings. Once you get the hang of it, this is an easy recipe to
scale up or down.

## Ingredients

- 450g / 16oz chicken breast (2 large pieces), skinless boneless
- 4 tbsp flour (sub cornflour/cornstarch for GF)
- 2 1/2 tbsp parmesan, finely grated
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 2 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp / 15g unsalted butter

### Lemon Sauce

- 2 tbsp / 30g unsalted butter, cut into 1.5cm / 1/2″ cubes
- 2/3 cup dry white wine
- 2 tbsp lemon juice, fresh
- 3 tbsp capers in brine, drained
- 1 1/2 tsp parsley, finely chopped, plus more for garnish

## Instructions

### Crispy Parmesan Chicken

- Cut each breast into 3 pieces. Then place between 2 pieces of cling wrap or
  paper and pound to 1/2 cm / 0.2″ thickness. (Note from DZ: I will generally
  butterfly the breasts if they are thick.)

- Drizzle chicken with 1/2 tbsp olive oil and spread with your fingers on both
  sides.

- Mix flour, parmesan, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Coat chicken, pressing
  to adhere, then shaking off excess.

- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Then add butter and
  let it melt.

- Place 3 pieces of chicken in the skillet. Cook 3 – 4 minutes until golden,
  then turn and cook the other side for 1 minute. (Note from DZ: I use an
  instant meat thermometer to avoid over-cooking the chicken)

- Remove onto plate, repeat with remaining chicken.

### Lemon Sauce

- Pour out and discard excess fat in skillet, then give it a quick wipe with
  paper towels (no need to clean thoroughly).
- Still on medium high heat, add wine. Let it simmer rapidly until it reduces by
  half – around 3 minutes.
- Add lemon and simmer 1 minute.

- Reduce heat to low. Add cubed butter and swirl pan to make it melt but not go
  foamy. Sauce should be glossy, translucent and slightly thickened.

- Stir in capers and parsley. Serve chicken with Sauce, sprinkled with extra
  parsley if desired!
